# MusicPlayerWithHandGesture
It's a music player commanded by hand gesture.




Just open the .sln file and build it.

But you need to configure the OpenCV3 first and put 4 songs named 1.mp3, 2.mp3... to the D:/songs/

the hand will be recognised and marked. 

slip to the left is the pause and continue
slip to the right is the next song.
slip up is volume up and slip down is volume dow.
